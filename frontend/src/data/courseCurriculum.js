          <p>Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, and feelings between individuals or groups. It involves a sender, message, medium, receiver, and feedback.</p>
          
          <h4>Key Components of Communication:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sender:</strong> The person who initiates the message</li>
            <li><strong>Message:</strong> The information being conveyed</li>
            <li><strong>Medium:</strong> The channel through which the message is sent</li>
            <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> The person who receives the message</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The response from the receiver</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Why Communication Matters:</h4>
          <p>Effective communication is essential for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building strong relationships</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>JavaScript Fundamentals Review</h3>
          <p>Before diving into advanced concepts, let's solidify your understanding of core JavaScript principles that form the foundation of modern web development.</p>
          
          <h4>Variables and Scope</h4>
          <pre><code>// Modern variable declarations
const name = 'John'; // Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned
let age = 30; // Block-scoped, can be reassigned
var city = 'Mumbai'; // Function-scoped (avoid in modern JS)

// Block scope example
if (true) {
  let blockVar = 'I am block scoped';
  const anotherBlockVar = 'Me too!';
}
// blockVar and anotherBlockVar are not accessible here</code></pre>
          
          <h4>Modern Function Syntax</h4>
          <pre><code>// Traditional function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function (ES6+)
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

// Higher-order functions
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);</code></pre>
          
          <h4>Destructuring and Spread Operator</h4>
          <pre><code>// Array destructuring
const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Object destructuring
const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25, city: 'Delhi' };
const { name, age } = person;

// Spread operator
const newArray = [...numbers, 6, 7, 8];
const newObject = { ...person, country: 'India' };</code></pre>
          
          <h4>Practice Exercise</h4>
          <p>Create a function that takes an array of user objects and returns only users above 18 years old, formatted with full names.</p>
